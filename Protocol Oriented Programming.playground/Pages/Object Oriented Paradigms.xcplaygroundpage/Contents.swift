/*:
# Object-Oriented Paradigm
Object-oriented design has served to reduce complexity

## Encapsulation
Group data and operations together
## Access Control
* Restrict implementation to supported API
* Prevent manipulation of implementation details
* Support invariance of data
## Abstraction
Types convey relatable ideas
## Namespacing
Names of methods and variables are not global but tightly scoped
## Expressiveness
> * bob's name -> bob.name
> * bob jumps ->  bob.jump()
* Operator overloading and subscripts
* Hide computation behind properties
## Extensibility
Can add additional functionality on top of the existing system
