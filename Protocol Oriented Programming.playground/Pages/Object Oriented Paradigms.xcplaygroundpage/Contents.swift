# Object-Oriented Paradigm
Object-oriented design has served to reduce complexity

### Encapsulation
Group data and operations together
### Access Control
* Restrict implementation to supported API
* Prevent manipulation of implementation details
* Support invariance of data
### Abstraction
Types convey relatable ideas
### Namespacing
Names of methods and variables are not global but tightly scoped
### Expressiveness
* "bob's name" -> `bob.name`
* "bob jumps" ->  `bob.jump()`
* Operator overloading and subscripts
* Hide computation behind properties
### Extensibility
Can add additional functionality on top of the existing system
### Polymorphism
Treat multiple things as interchangable

Many believe subtype polymorphism (class inheritance) is a required feature for a language to be Object-Oriented.
